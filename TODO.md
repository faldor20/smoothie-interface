[] 1. Heater T0 data never shows up next to red/white tick
[x]2. The graphs are shit and a waste of time in my view and should go altogether
[x]3. The third column contents can go altogether- we don’t need to be able to extrude/reverse as we have screen on printer for that- however, enable second extruder check box we need to keep for switching between dual and single extruder printers
[x]4. I would have it auto check temperatures every 3 seconds by default and get rid of the check box options for that
	i would need to look into this, angular gets the info from 
[x]5. Get rid of the speed and motors off boxes and buttons
[x]6. Change “controls” label to “Movement Controls”
[x]7. Change Middle column heading to “Temperature Control”
[x]8. Change middle column sub headings to “Name Off Temp Set Value/Target”
[x]9. Change “Heater T0” to “Extruder LHS” and “Heater T0” to “Extruder RHS”
[x]10. Change default temps from “0” to 220 for extruders and 60 for bed
[]11. Instead of the temp graphs may have label that says: “Preheat 10°C above print temperatures”
[]12. It should have a “connected” indicator up top next to name of printer- this should be easy as we are getting temp every 3 seconds so you should be getting data packets back beginning with “ok” every three seconds- if not then printer is turned off or not connected to network – you can see this data in the bottom right hand corner in commands window.
[]13. Replace “Smoothieware webUI” with “Workshop 3DP webUI:”
[]14. Get rid of the Language option for polish, just English as default.
